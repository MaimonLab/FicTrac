# FicTrac
FicTrac provides ball tracking functionality for tethered fly experiments and was originally developed by Richard Moore.  He has generously provided us with the source code for FicTrac, but has requested that we not share it with others until he has a versioning system set up.  Please respect his wishes and keep all source local to the lab.
